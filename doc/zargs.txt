INTRODUCTION                                    *zargs*

Zargs provides a few helpers for managing the arg-list.

Usage:
Zargs filename
ZargsList
ZargsRead

The passed-in filename needs to be within 'zargs' directory within the vim-zargs plugin directory.

Examples:
Zargs "foo" # Populate the arg-list from the contents of the "foo" file
ZargsList   # Open up the "zargs" directory in a snippet
ZargsRead   # Populate the arg-list from the contents of the current buffer

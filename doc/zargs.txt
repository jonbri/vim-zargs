INTRODUCTION                                    *zargs*

Zargs provides a few helpers for managing the arg-list.

Usage:
Zargs filename
ZargsList
ZargsRead

The passed-in filename needs to be within 'zargs' directory within the vim-zargs plugin directory.

Examples:
Zargs "foo" # Populate the arg-list from the contents of the "foo" file

                                                *ZargsRead*
ZargsRead               Populate the arg-list from the contents of the current buffer

                                                *ZargsList*
ZargsList               Open Netrw to the zargs list directory

                                                *zp*
zp                      Print out full path to current buffer
